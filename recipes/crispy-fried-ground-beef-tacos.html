    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for ground beef tacos. They are crispy and delicious! They take less than an hour to make and can be completed in three easy steps!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/3 cup finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons taco seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>2/3 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup oil, divided</li>
        <li>12 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>lettuce, salsa, sour cream, and cilantro for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook, breaking up clumps with a spatula, until fat renders out and beef begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring constantly until onion is softened and beef is crumbly, about 4 minutes. Drain fat if desired.</li>
        <li>Add desired amount of taco seasoning and cook for 1 minute. Add in tomato paste and water and cook, using a spoon to loosen any browned bits from the pan, and stir until well combined. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Carefully place tortilla in hot oil until it begins to bubble and brown. Flip tortilla and top with 2 tablespoons shredded cheese all over. Next, add about 1/4 cup ground beef mixture on half of the tortilla. Using tongs and a spatula, carefully fold tortilla in half and cook until well browned on both sides. Drain well on paper towels. Repeat with remaining oil, tortillas, taco meat and cheese.</li>
        <li>Carefully open and fill tacos as desired. Serve immediately.</li>
