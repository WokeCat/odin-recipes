# odin-recipes
This project is to be a simple recipe webpage. I will aim to use the skills I have recently learnt. To include a main page, a few links to recipe pages. Pictures and some formatting to be included. 
Self reflection to follow upon completion of project
Focus on understanding git 

Project completion reflection:
Completely forgot about regularly committing to git and using it. Need to reflect on this and practise. Lack full understanding of how and when to do it so need to revisit this.
